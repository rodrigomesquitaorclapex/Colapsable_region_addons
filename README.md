The demo have the example to add the following add ons

1. Expand and collapse all: I miss a dynamic action to collapse and expand all to make it easy to find a region on a page with multiple regions. We have the dynamic action to colapse tree but not regions.

2. Save the collapsible state beyond the session: Currently, we can save the collapsible state, but unfortunately, it's only saved for the session. If I collapse a region that isn't important to me, logging off and logging in again resets my chosen state.
